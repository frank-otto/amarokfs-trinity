Amarok Full Screen GUI for the Trinity Desktop Environment
==========================================================

This is an addon for the music player Amarok 1.4, in the version from the
Trinity desktop environment (see https://www.trinitydesktop.org/),
which started as a fork of the KDE3.5 desktop environment.
It will most likely not work with KDE4/KDE5/... versions of Amarok.

For installation instructions, see INSTALL.

Then simply run the binary, amarokFS.
To quit, press Esc or Alt+F4.
