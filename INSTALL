Build/Installation instructions
===============================

This has been tested with Trinity Desktop Environment TDE R14.0.3
on Ubuntu "Trusty" 14.04.  It is assumed that TDE (or at least the
package amarok-trinity) has been installed through the package
manager, apt.


1) Install the following packages:

tqt3-dev-tools
libtqt3-headers
libtqtinterface-dev
tdelibs14-trinity-dev


2) Run the following commands:

tqmake
make
sudo make install


Make sure that '/opt/trinity/bin' is in your PATH,
and that '/opt/trinity/lib' is in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
The 'amarokFS' binary will be located in '/usr/local/bin'.
